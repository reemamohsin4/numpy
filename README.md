# Numpy for Beginners

This repository contains various different python files in which I used the **Numpy** library 
to read data and perform operations and visualizations.

### Cereal data

For this script, data is imported from the `cereal.csv` file. Here, I perform statistical calculations on the cereal data
to get used to numpy functions. 

### Election data

There is no source data file for this code. All data is instantiated within `election.py`. Again, I use the Numpy library
functions to understand the election results from a given set of vote records.

### Recipes data

For this script, data is imported from the `recipes.csv` file. Here, I perform statistical calculations and visualizations
using **Matplotlib**. 

## Conclusion

The purpose of these files are to learn basic Python operations with the Numpy library. This is a project for beginners.
